            -rework it to where you have a dictionary of all string values and in the node, you have the node_#_#_# and just find the key, and print the value corespond to the key which would be the string/narrative story


    -2nd Step(GUI Interface)
        -Input widget where if you input the name/index of the item you want, then you equip it to the correlated place


    -3rd Step
        -Create enemies
        -Create a battle system where people can attack
            -Distance from enemies matters, resistances matter, health matters, type of attack matters
            -If there are enemies and engage them, you will append two nodes inside the main/next node function. If you go to zero HP,  you lost and something happens, if you don't go to zero hp and the enemey does, then the stories goes in a different path
        -Create an inspect enemies to see spells, weapons, armor, equipment, etc.
